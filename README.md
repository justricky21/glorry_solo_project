<h2>A simple logistics app concept<br>Herokuapp: https://glorry-sinatra-app.herokuapp.com/</h2>



This was my solo Ruby/Sinatra solo project for the CodeClan software developer course.

In this, a user, initially designed to be a logistics manager, can create and add, edit, archive and, possibly, delete lorry drivers, customers and deliveries.

The goal of this was to solidify CRUD concepts, which were relatively new at that time in the course, understand how to create SQL commands in a different language and generally apply basic UX concepts to to our understanding of coding.

The design of the application, starting with the font and colour choices, was envisioned with a 90's outlook. When I decided what the colour combination would be and provided a crude draft to my brother, he said it looked like one of those applications which run in Internet Explorer in a tube monitor. I took that as a form of inspiration, and went with it.

The application was build in Test Driven Development, in a Movel-View-Controller design structure. It uses PostgreSQL as it's database.

The latest commits might seem confusing, but it was my first attempt at deploying an application in heroku app. The repetition steemed from the fact I could not see changes without committing them. Now that the knowledge is solidified, my other projects do no suffer from this.

Thanks for visiting! You can test my app in the heroku link at the beginning of this document. Cheers!
